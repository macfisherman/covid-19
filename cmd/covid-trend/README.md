To build: go build .

To run: ./covid-trend Massachusetts

An HTML file will be created that can be loaded in a browser. It shows all the counties for a state and their confirmed case count.

_NOTE_
This program requires a forked version of e-charts. Pull the forked version (available in macfisherman repo) of e-charts to share the same parent directory of covid-trend.
